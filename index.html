Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).
<br>
Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
<br>
<p>
Origami helped inspire the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, which was later turned into a movie.
<br>
The absolute easiest and best origami animal to start with is the origami cat face.
</p>
<p>
The word "Origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
<br>
Origami was initially known as orikata (folded shapes).
<br>
The hardest Origami to make is the Ancient Dragon designed by Satoshi Kamiya, which took around 16 hours of work.
</p>
<p>
Earliest records of origami indicate that it was used primarily for religious or ceremonial reasons. 
<br>
Eventually, as people became more interested in it, origami was used for decorative and artistic purposes. 
<br>
It was also used as a tool to teach basic principles of math and geometry.
